[Unibo Go](https://github.com/csunibo/unibo-go) is where the Go package [`unibo`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/csunibo/unibo-go) is being developed. It serves as a wrapper for the [unibo.it](https://unibo.it) APIs. This enables all other Go projects at CSUnibo requiring information from [unibo.it](https://unibo.it) to interface with this package without worrying about interacting directly with the Unibo platform.
