git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Create a `.env` file with:

```env

```

To start a development instance:

pnpm dev
```

## Compilation

To compile a production instance:

```

```

## Public Instances

There are several public instances of Dynamik:

- [main](https://risorse.students.cs.unibo.it);
- [GitHub Pages](https://csunibo.github.io/dynamik) (slower, without SSR);
