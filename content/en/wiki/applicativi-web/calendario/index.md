## Description

The application allows obtaining the class schedules of a degree course at the University of Bologna in ical format. Users can choose from available degree courses and select which classes to add to their calendar.

The project did not originate within CSUnibo, but a public instance is maintained by us. The [original project](https://github.com/FrancescoBonzi/UniboCalendar) is by Francesco Bonzi.

## Usage

1. Go to the website [https://calendar.students.cs.unibo.it/](https://calendar.students.cs.unibo.it/)
2. Select the desired degree course and click "Next"
3. Choose the classes of interest and click "Get calendar"
4. \[Optional\] Configure calendar notifications (e.g., 30 minutes before the class)
5. Use the buttons `Add to Google` or `Add to Apple` to add the calendar to your personal calendar.

The "Add to Apple" button actually works with many calendar services, not just with Apple.

To add it to other software, right-click on the `Add to Apple` button, copy the address, and paste it into your software under "add calendar from remote source" or similar.
