Peer workshops are educational events organized by CartaBinaria and conducted by and for individuals studying in the Degree Courses of our department. They cover essential basic knowledge for those within our scope that are not addressed during any course. All materials are available at [`cartabinaria/lab`](https://github.com/cartabinaria/lab).

You can sign up or suggest new topics for peer workshops through the ["CartaBinaria Listening"](https://lr533gb3hpt.typeform.com/to/m5fzNCsW) form.

The materials are available and can be accessed on [this
page](https://dynamik.vercel.app/lab).
