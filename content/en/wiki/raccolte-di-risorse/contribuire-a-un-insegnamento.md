If you're new to this, using GitHub's web interface is an easy way to contribute to a course's resources:

1. When you view the resources you want to modify, to the right of the path at the top of the page, click on the GitHub icon {{< icon pack=fab name=github >}};
2. In the top right, click on "Fork" and, on the resulting page, "Create fork";
3. You will see `github.com/username/repository-name`. Use it like a shared folder (disconnected from the original project) to add or modify content;
4. If you are adding files with new extensions that were not previously present, specify them in `.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml`;
5. Your content should meet all the items in the ["Quality Control"](..) paragraph;
6. When you're done, open the "Contribute" dropdown and click "Open pull request": choose a title and a message (optional) to describe your work, then click "Create pull request".

You've just requested that your changes be integrated into the original collection. A volunteer will review and accept the request.
